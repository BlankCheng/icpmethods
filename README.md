# icpmethods
some iterative closest point methods in python

**icp_point_to_point_SVD:**     <p align="left">work</p>
**icp_point_to_plane_LS:**      work  
**icp_point_to_point_LM:**      not work  
**icp_point_to_plane_LM:**      not work  
**icp_point_to_point_open3d:**  work  
**icp_point_to_plane_open3d:**  work  
**icp_color_open3d:**           rarely work  
**icp_pcl:**                    not yet included  


These methods are only concerned with "error minimization" module, other modules of icp are not considered. There are currently 2 "matching" methods: point2point distance/ projective distance. Projective distance does not work now.
